###Lots of people write "Happy Birthday INSERT_NAME_HERE". Lets start a new Trend.

Instead of a generic message lets send Quotes!
Not quotes from other people, but original sayings you come up
with that positively reflects your friend.

Here are some examples: 

"The most charismatic person I have ever met!"

"Someone who is always there for you"

"Can't spend 10 minutes with you without laughing"


These quotes do 2 things.

.1 : Act as a complement to your friend that they can remember forever.
.1 : They can use these quotes to prove to others their loyalty, personality, reliability, etc..."

Give them a try. I'm sure your friends will appreciate them.
